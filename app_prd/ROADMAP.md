# EventGenie Roadmap

## Design
- Change the app name throughout the UI and assets to the new name (TBD).
- Add improved design elements for a more visually appealing, modern, and engaging user experience (e.g., better color palette, typography, spacing, and iconography).
- Redesign the flyer preview to display the event summary as a visually styled image, not just styled text.

## Backend
- Update any references to the old app name in API responses, documentation, and code comments.
- (Optional) Add an endpoint to generate flyer images from event summaries (using a library like Pillow, or a service like html2image or a headless browser).

## Frontend
- Update all references to the app name in the codebase, UI, and metadata.
- Integrate new design elements and styles (e.g., update MUI theme, add custom components, improve layout).
- Change the flyer preview so that the event summary is rendered as an image (e.g., using an HTML-to-canvas library like html2canvas, or by generating an SVG or Canvas-based flyer).
- Add download/share functionality for the flyer image.

**Next Steps:**
1. Decide on the new app name.
2. Prioritize design improvements and flyer image generation.
3. Implement changes iteratively, starting with the most visible UI updates.
