## 6. Narrative
It's Thursday evening, and Sarah just realized her best friend's birthday is this weekend. Instead of panicking, she opens EventGenie and types: "Fun 25th birthday party for my adventurous friend who loves tacos and karaoke, about 15 people, $200 budget."

Within seconds, the app suggests a taco bar setup with three protein options, a playlist of crowd-pleasing karaoke songs, and decoration ideas in her friend's favorite colors. Sarah loves the suggestions but swaps the pi√±ata for a photo booth backdrop.

With a few taps, EventGenie generates a vibrant flyer featuring the taco and karaoke theme. Sarah adds the party details, and the app creates a guest list from her contacts. She sends the flyer via text to 15 friends, and the app automatically creates a planning timeline with reminders to buy decorations and prep the taco bar.

Saturday arrives, and Sarah's stress-free party is a hit. Her friend is thrilled, guests are raving about the setup, and Sarah is already planning her next event using EventGenie.
