# Here’s a summary of all the major changes and outcomes from this session:



## **Major Changes & Outcomes**

### **Frontend**
1. **Two-Page SPA with React Router**
   - The app now uses React Router for navigation between the event prompt page and the event result page.
   - Users can easily go back and forth between pages, with state and data preserved.

2. **Event History with LocalStorage Persistence**
   - Every generated event (with flyer image and details) is saved to a persistent history in localStorage.
   - The event history is grouped and displayed by “Today,” “Yesterday,” and earlier dates.
   - Newest events appear at the top of each section.
   - History persists across browser reloads.

3. **Improved Event Prompt and Result UI**
   - The event prompt page includes all required fields (description, date, time, location, flyer style).
   - After generating an event, the result page shows a summary, flyer image, and flyer text.
   - The prompt page always displays the last generated event and the full event history.

4. **Back Button Navigation**
   - The result page features a prominent “Back” button that returns the user to the prompt page without clearing the last result or history.

5. **TypeScript Linter Fixes**
   - All TypeScript errors related to event history grouping and rendering have been resolved with explicit typing.

### **Backend**
1. **OpenAI Integration for Event Plan and Flyer Image**
   - The backend generates a structured event plan (JSON) and a flyer image using OpenAI’s GPT and DALL·E APIs.
   - The flyer image prompt ensures event details (date, time, place) are large and visible.

2. **System Prompt and Data Handling**
   - The backend system prompt and user prompt are updated to include all event details and flyer style.
   - The backend returns a JSON object with all event details and the flyer image URL.

---

### **User Experience Outcomes**
- Users can generate, view, and revisit event plans and flyers with a modern, persistent, and organized UI.
- Event history is always available and grouped by date for easy reference.
- The app is robust, user-friendly, and ready for further enhancements (like email sharing, which was discussed).
